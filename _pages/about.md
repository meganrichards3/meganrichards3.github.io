## About Me
I'm a first year Computer Science PhD student at [NYU's Courant Institute for Mathmatical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/), working with [Kyunghyun Cho](https://kyunghyuncho.me/). My PhD is supported by NYU's [Dean's Doctoral Fellowship](https://gsas.nyu.edu/admissions/financial-aid/diversity-and-access-funding-programs.html), and the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP)](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). Previously, I was an AI Resident at [Meta AI](https://ai.meta.com/research/) (FAIR labs) where I was fortunate to be advised by [Mark Ibrahim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=AqYyoCMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Diane Bouchacourt](https://dianebouchacourt.github.io/).   

I study the **foundations of reliable machine learning**, with the goal of making models more consistent, representative, fair, and useful. Most recently, I have studied geographical failures in vision models, including studying the [widening progress gap between imagenet-based benchmarks and global, crowdsourced data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13136) (ICLR 2024), [mechanisms of geographical bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05391) (Spotlight, NeurIPS 2023), and [improving measurement of geographic disparities in image generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11988) (Outstanding Paper, TiFA workshop ICML 2024).

My current research interests in machine learning reliability are motivated by my experiences building models for high-stakes medical settings. I completed my undergradate at Duke University, where I worked with [Mark Sendak](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U0kHK8wAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) as part of the Duke Institute for Healthcare Innovation ([DIHI](https://dihi.org/projects/)). At DIHI, I worked on building risk prediction models for [severe pregnancy complications](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59d5ac1780bd5ef9c396eda6/t/62eb0bc60a2601399afdfecf/1659571143037/108+MEWS_Abstract.pdf), which are now integrated and in silent trials. I also worked with DIHI to implement a [data quality assurance framework](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v182/sendak22a.html) which improved model performance by better integrating clinical feedback into dataset design. While at Duke, I also worked at the [Duke Center for Global Women's Health Technologies](https://www.dukegwht.org/) on a [self-screening device](https://spj.science.org/doi/full/10.34133/2022/9823184?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D14000684186094648760814905405683999528%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1696809600) for cervical cancer designed for low-resource global settings, which earned a Best Research award at NIH's IEEE HIPOCT Conference in 2019. 

## Recent Updates
- **July '24**:🎊 We're honored to receive an **outstanding paper award** at the ICML TiFA workshop for our work measuring geographic disparities in image generations! It was such a pleasure to help supervise this project, led by Abhishek Sureddy, Dishant Padelia, and Nandhinee Periyakaruppa. 

- **May '24**: 📝 Check out our [Introduction to Vision-Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17247), created through a broad collaboration of researchers (> 40 people across 10 institutions) to help democratize knowledge about VLMs! 

- **April '24**: 🎓 This fall, I will start a PhD at [NYU Computer Science](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html), working with [Kyunghyun Cho](https://kyunghyuncho.me/). My work will be supported by NYU's [GSAS Dean's Doctoral Fellowship](https://gsas.nyu.edu/admissions/financial-aid/diversity-and-access-funding-programs.html), as well as the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP)](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). 

- **Jan '24**: 📝 We're thrilled to have our work accepted at [ICLR 2024](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/CallForPapers)! Our work demonstrates a widening progress gap between imagenet-based benchmarks and global, crowdsourced data, driven by significant overrepresentation of western images in internet-scraped datasets.    
  
- **Dec '23**: 🎊 We're honored to receive a **spotlight award** at NeurIPS 2023 under the datasets track for our paper investigating mechanisms of geographical bias in vision models! See full paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05391), our annotations [here](https://dollarstreetfactors.metademolab.com/?at=-24%2C40.67%2C2.5)!
